# Getting Started with Bingo Game

How to play?

In tradational Bingo! game we used we had a 5x5 matrix and a player announces a number to be crossed and all the players crossed the number (including himself/herself). Then next player announced a number to be crossed and all other players crossed the number, and so on.
The aim of the game is to make a total of 5 fully crossed rows/columns/diagonal. The player which creates 5 such rows/columns/diagonals first wins.

In digital version, we have a 5x5 matrix.
1. Click on new game and wait for other players to join (Share the code with your frieds to let them join).
2. Click on Start button to start the game.
3. Now you have an empty matrix.
4. Click on an empty cell to fill the numbers consecutively from 1-25.
5. You can create any pattern you like.
6. When numbers are filled from 1-25, matrix is locked. You can click on Reset button to fill in nummbers again.
7. Now when all numbers are filled, Player 1 click on number he/she want to cross. All other player's numbers will be crossed automatically.
8. Then Player 2 clicks on number he/she wishes to cross according to his matrix pattern and so on.
9. Player which gets a total of 5 crossed rows/column/diagonal wins the game.
